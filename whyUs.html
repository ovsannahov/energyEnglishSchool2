                üåü Group classes are the key to effective and exciting
                learning!<br /><br />
                üí° Group classes allow you to use a creative approach when
                children work on projects and tasks together. This stimulates
                their creativity and joint mental development.<br /><br />
                ü§ù Group classes provide a unique opportunity for children to
                interact, communicate and learn together. This shared experience
                helps develop communication and social skills that are extremely
                important in today's world.<br /><br />
                ü§ì In group classes, children learn from each other. They
                observe others, exchange thoughts and ideas, which creates many
                opportunities for growth and development.
