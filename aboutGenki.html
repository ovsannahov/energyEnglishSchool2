          That's right, "Genki" means "fun", "exciting" and "full of life" in
          Japanese. Genki English's vision is to make learning English fun and
          effective. Remember, when children are having fun, they are more
          motivated to learn. They are more open to new ideas and more willing
          to participate. Therefore, our mission is to create an exciting
          learning environment where children can enjoy the process of learning
          English.
