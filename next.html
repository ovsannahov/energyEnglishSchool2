            <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
            <p>We already know how to speak English. We already know how to read. So, what are we going to do to keep our passion for the English language alive and take it to the next level?</p>
            <p>We use English as a medium for learning another subject. This is the CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) method - studying all or several subjects of the school curriculum in English. It can be art, history, geography, biology, mathematics, chemistry, literature, and even physical education. Thus, we experiment, improvise, learn about the world, analyze in English, fully immersed in the language environment.</p>

            <h2>At this stage, according to the CLIL methodology:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li class="li-clil">CLIL students do <b> NOT </b> learn the language that students usually learn in English classes.</li>
        <li class="li-clil">CLIL students do <b> NOT </b>  follow a curriculum that is based on the development of grammar.</li>
        <li class="li-clil">CLIL students do <b> NOT </b>  learn tourism language patterns such as "Can you tell me the way to the Eiffel Tower?" or "How much is this t-shirt?"</li>
        <li class="li-clil">CLIL students do <b> NOT </b>  study language on topics that are usually found in language textbooks, such as My Family, Travel, or Advertising. In other words, CLIL teachers do NOT teach basic interpersonal skills (BICS).</li>
